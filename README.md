# Externatic
*student project*

## Presentation

[Externatic](https://www.externatic.fr/) is a company specializing in IT profile recruitment.
Our mission was to create a hirement website. We have decided to focus on facilitating the hiring process for both candidates and companies. With just one click, a candidate can apply for a job offer, and companies can easily update applications.You can find a demo of the application [here](https://www.loom.com/share/b2266e12c2aa40419b5a8efb44e4042d?sid=9112185d-7a4e-4c5f-8111-6635b3dd207f).
